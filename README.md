To gain access to the dark web, you'll need to download the Tor Browser, which is a modified version of Firefox that provides high-level security for browsing the dark web.

The Tor Browser is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android at https://www.torproject.org/download/. If you're using an iOS device, you can download the Onion Browser at https://onionbrowser.com/. Alternatively, you can use the Brave Browser, which supports Tor and Onion protocols and is available for both desktop and mobile devices at https://brave.com/download/.


Is it Legal to Access the Dark Web?

Using Tor is legal in most countries. However, there are certain illegal activities that are prohibited, such as buying or selling drugs, weapons, counterfeit money, abusive materials, and other illegal activities depending on your residency.


What is the Darknet?

The Web is divided into three major areas: the surface web (clearnet), the deep web, and the dark web. The surface web consists of publicly accessible resources such as search engines, news sites, and social media platforms that can be indexed by search engines. The deep web is made up of resources that are not indexed by search engines and are typically protected by passwords or stored behind public services such as internal company platforms, medical records, research papers, and legal documents. Finally, the dark web consists of resources that can only be accessed through specific software and are not accessible via a standard web browser. This includes secure drops for whistleblowers, secret communication channels for activists, journalists, and human rights activists, as well as illegal marketplaces and shops.


What is Tor?

Tor (The Onion Router) is an open-source software that routes Internet traffic through a global network of almost a million relays to hide the user's location and protect them against surveillance or traffic analysis. Tor makes it difficult to trace Internet activity such as website visits, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms.


How Does Tor Work?

Your traffic passes through three intermediate nodes before reaching its destination. Each of these three nodes has a separate layer of encryption, and nobody who watches your connection can read what you send and where.

The three nodes are as follows:

- Guard node: Knows your IP address but doesn't know where you're connecting to or what you're sending to your destination.
- Middle node: Sits between the guard node and the exit node.
- Exit node: Knows the destination but doesn't know who you are.


What are Hidden Services?

Hidden services are only accessible within the Tor network, and their domain names end with .onion. They are not indexed by any public search engine, and the only way to access .onion sites is to know their specific addresses. Some examples of deep web links can be found in the table above.


How to Find Hidden Services

There are many Tor link lists, wikis, and catalogs where you can find addresses to .onion sites. However, most link lists in the clearnet are not updated, and most links do not work. Hidden services are typically only available for a short period of time before they disappear forever.

This Github page is maintained by volunteers, which means it is updated more frequently to provide better access to information. There are some darknet search engines that are mostly created by amateurs, but they are very limited due to the nature of hidden services.

Before accessing any darknet site, make sure that it's legal in your country to browse the content that they contain.


Who Created Tor?

The idea of onion routing was created in 1995 at the U.S. Naval Research Lab by David Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson as part of a research project to create Internet connections that do not reveal who is talking to whom.
